# Foxus Profiler

This is a helper library used in the [Foxus](https://github.com/cryptovoxels/foxus) project to integrate the
[Perfetto](https://perfetto.dev/) profiler into all components of the system.

This library is provided in the [foxus_prebuilts](https://github.com/cryptovoxels/foxus_prebuilts) repository in binary
form. To rebuild, look for the build script in that repository.
